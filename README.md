## 🚀 About Me
 * I’m a self-taught backend developer with a strong passion for programming and building efficient, scalable systems. At 20 years old, I’m constantly learning and improving my skills in backend technologies, and I currently study Software Engineering  at Canterbury Christ Church University.

* When I’m not coding, I enjoy chess, watching anime, and occasionally gaming in my free time. These hobbies help me relax and fuel my creative thinking for my software projects.



## 🛠 Core Backend Skills
* Python (Flask)
* PostgreSQL
* MongoDB
## 🛠 Additional Skills

* Passionate about mobile development using Flutter for various applications.

* Experience with web technologies for small to moderate projects.

* Comfortable with full-stack development for self-initiated or side projects, creating well-rounded, functional solutions.


## Current Projects And 
👩‍💻 I’m currently focused on building my backend portfolio, while also developing my step_sync library for Flutter. This library helps count steps using raw sensor data and mathematical calculations. Alongside this, I’m expanding my portfolio with additional projects and handling small, local freelance jobs.

🧠 I believe learning is a continuous journey. While I’ve gained proficiency in my core backend skills, I’m always pushing to expand my knowledge. In the future, I’m particularly excited to dive deeper into FastAPI and further strengthen my expertise in backend development.  

👯‍♀️ I'm looking to collaborate on anything that interests me and suitable for my level to collaborate.
